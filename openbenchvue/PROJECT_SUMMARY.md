# Launch GUI (default)
openbenchvue
```

### CLI Mode
```bash
# Scan for instruments
openbenchvue --scan

# Connect to specific instrument
openbenchvue --connect "USB0::0x1234::0x5678::INSTR"

instruments = detector.auto_connect()

# Use instrument
dmm = instruments['DMM_1']
voltage = dmm.measure()
print(f"Voltage: {voltage}V")
```

## Testing Recommendations

### Unit Testing
Create tests for:
- Instrument drivers (mock VISA communication)
- Automation blocks (mock instruments)
- Data processing (known inputs/outputs)
- Sequence serialization
- Configuration management

### Integration Testing
Test with:
- Actual instruments (if available)
- VISA simulators
- Different VISA backends
- Various OS (Windows, Linux, macOS)

### GUI Testing
Use pytest-qt for:
- Widget creation
- User interactions
- Signal/slot connections
- Dialog behaviors

## Known Limitations

1. **Instrument Coverage**
   - Drivers focus on common Keysight models
   - May need customization for other brands
   - Some advanced features not implemented

2. **GUI Features**
   - Simplified compared to full BenchVue
   - Drag-and-drop sequence builder is basic
   - Some instrument panels are minimal
   - No built-in dark theme (yet)

3. **Performance**
   - Large datasets may impact performance
   - Real-time plot limited to 1000 points
   - No hardware acceleration

4. **Platform Support**
   - Tested primarily on Windows/Linux
   - macOS support expected but not verified
   - VISA backend availability varies by platform
